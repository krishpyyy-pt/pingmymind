In the world of cybersecurity, we talk a lot about threats, vulnerabilities, and frameworks. We see the official reports, the conference keynotes, and the CVE numbers.


But who are the people making the critical decisions? What personal stories and hard-won lessons shaped the experts that they are today. 


I've always wanted to go deeper than the policy and the technical specs.That's why I am incredibly excited to announce the launch of **Banter & Binary**, a new interview series dedicated to the human element of cybersecurity.


<h3>What is Banter & Binary?</h3>


Banter & Binary is a space for candid, raw conversations with the architects of digital trust. We'll be sitting down with the CISOs, the researchers, the ethical hackers, and the industry leaders who are on the front lines.


We're going "beyond the firewall" to explore:

* The personal journeys behind the job titles. * The "sliding doors" moments that defined their careers in security. * The leadership principles they use to build secure teams. * Their unfiltered predictions for the future of cyber defense.


<h3>Our First Guest</h3>

I am absolutely honored to announce that we are launching this series with a true giant in the field.

While I'm holding the full reveal for just a little longer, I can tell you this: He is a household name for anyone involved in application security and is famous for his foundational work with OWASP. He is the perfect person to kick off this conversation.


Stay Tuned!

The official announcement of our first guest is coming very soon, followed by the full interview. To make sure you don't miss it, follow me here on the blog and connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/kavyansh-garg)
